"""
Task-level evaluation judge for RealDevice environment.
Uses a VLM (Vision-Language Model) to determine whether the agent 
has successfully completed the given task, by comparing the previous and final screenshots.

Since real devices have no server-side /task/eval, we use a VLM as a substitute.
This is called when the agent outputs "answer", "terminate", or "status" action.

TASK_EVAL_JUDGE_PROMPT = """You are an expert evaluator for mobile device task completion. Your job is to determine whether the agent has successfully completed the given task on the phone.

## Task Goal
{task_goal}

## Action History Summary
The agent performed {num_steps} steps to attempt this task.
Last action: {last_action}

## Visual Input
- [Image 1] The PREVIOUS screenshot (before the last action was executed).
- [Image 2] The FINAL screenshot (after the last action — the current screen state).

By comparing the two screenshots, you can see what changed as a result of the last action and whether progress was made.

## Evaluation Criteria

You must determine if the task goal has been **fully achieved** based on the final screenshot (Image 2). Use the previous screenshot (Image 1) for context to understand what changed.

### Success (score=1)
The final screen state clearly shows the task has been completed. Examples:
- If the task was to "open Settings", the Settings app is visible and active.
- If the task was to "search for X", the search results for X are displayed.
- If the task was to "send a message to Y", the message appears in the chat.
- If the task was to "set alarm for 7:00 AM", the alarm is visible in the alarm list.
- If the task was to "turn on WiFi", WiFi is shown as enabled.

### Failure (score=0)
The final screen state does NOT confirm task completion. Examples:
- The screen shows a different app or page than expected.
- The task required a specific action but the screen doesn't reflect it.
- The agent appears to be stuck on an intermediate step.
- The screen shows an error or unexpected state.
- There is no clear evidence that the task was accomplished.

## Important Notes
- Be strict: only give score=1 if you can clearly see evidence of task completion.
- Consider partial completion as failure (score=0) unless the core objective is met.
- If the screenshot is unclear or corrupted, default to score=0.

## Output Format
Output strictly in the following JSON format, with no additional text:
{{"reason": "Brief explanation of why the task succeeded or failed", "score": 0 or 1}}""".strip()
