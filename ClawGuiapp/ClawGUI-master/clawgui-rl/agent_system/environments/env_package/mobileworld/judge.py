STEP_REWARD_JUDGE_PROMPT = """You are an expert in evaluating mobile operation agents. Your task is to analyze the task goal, action history, current action, and the visual changes in screenshots to determine if the current step provides a positive contribution toward completing the task.

## Task Goal
{task_goal}

## Action History (From most recent to earliest)
{action_history}

## Current Action
{current_action}

## Visual Input
- [Image 1] Screenshot BEFORE the action. (For click actions, a red dot indicates the interaction point to help you identify the element).
- [Image 2] Screenshot AFTER the action.

## Analysis Process
Please analyze following these steps:
1. **Goal Understanding**: Clarify what the task requires for successful completion.
2. **Progress Assessment**: Based on the action history, determine the current progress stage.
3. **Action Analysis**: Identify exactly what was done in the current step (clicked element, input text, or scroll direction).
4. **Screenshot Comparison**: Compare Image 1 and Image 2 to observe if any meaningful UI changes occurred.
5. **Final Judgment**: Synthesize the above analysis to determine if the action was helpful.

## Evaluation Standards

### Helpful (reward=1)
The action moves the interface state toward the task goal. Examples:
- Opened the correct app related to the task.
- Clicked a button or link that advances the task workflow.
- Entered the correct content as required by the task.
- Navigated to a page necessary for completing the task.

### Unhelpful (reward=0)
The action failed to advance the task. Examples:
- Screenshots before and after are nearly identical (action was ineffective or failed to trigger).
- The current action is a complete repetition of the previous step (stuck in a loop).
- Clicked on an irrelevant area or element.
- Mis-touch caused the UI to deviate from the goal direction.
- Opened the wrong application or page.

## Output Format
Output strictly in the following JSON format, with no additional text:
{{"reason": "Brief explanation of the judgment", "reward": 0 or 1}}""".strip()
